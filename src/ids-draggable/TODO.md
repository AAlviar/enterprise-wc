- consider mobile touch
- convert mouse/drag touch events to a custom event interface (not sure whether to use "drag", "dragstart", "dragend" yet)
- restrict parent bounds of movement when parentContainment is true
- known issue (minor): in firefox, the cursor when moved quickly flashes between dragging/default as the positioning/detection
isnt instant as it is in chrome
