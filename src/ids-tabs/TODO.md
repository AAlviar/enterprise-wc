# Tabs TODO's

## Phase 1

Tentative for Phase 1 but certain things e.g. overflows may need to  get done in Phase 2 since they are not directly functional depending on time.

- [] hashes
- [] ids-tabs-divider: accessibility + axe tests
- [] tab divider test coverage
- [] detect overflows
- [] accessibility: let user tab off of ids-tabs
