# Ids Clearable Mixin

This mixin adds a clear button (x icon) to an input element ands bind click and key events to clear the text in the input when clicked. It will trigger the `cleared` when the contents of the input element are cleared and a `contents-checked` event when the contents of input are being checked for empty.
