# TODO for IDS Popup

- [ ] Create a "Click in the boundary" page that places a Popup by coordinates.
adding `shouldUpdate: true` setting to the `connectedCallback`
- [ ] Add tests for "type"
- [ ] Add option to close on clicking out in the page
- [ ] Improve "alignTarget" to accept an element reference directly (IDS Popup Menu).
- [ ] Rename "containment" to "constraint"
- [] Add "flip" and "nudge" logic
- [] Might also need to create Ids Popup Boundary?
- [] Apply an IdsPopupMenu to an element with API for open/close and menu functions
