# Ids Picker Popup

IdsPickerPopup serves as a base component for Picker-type components to be built, such as [`IdsDatePicker`](../ids-date-picker/README.md).  This component encapsulates an [`IdsPopup`](../ids-popup/README.md) along with several helper mixins that manage attachment to other elements, triggering events, show/hide behavior, and more.
