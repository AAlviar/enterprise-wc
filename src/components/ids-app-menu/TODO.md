# Ids App Menu TODOs

## Minor

- [ ] Implement more efficient system for filter-then-collapse behavior (make it collapse panels with no filtered children)
- [ ] Complete IdsHighlight utility and implement against matching text in accordion headers. (infor-design/enterprise-wc#494)
- [ ] Personalization (colored menu) - do we need it?
- [ ] Roll Switcher - has several designs need to land on one first
