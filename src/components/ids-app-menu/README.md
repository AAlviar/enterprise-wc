# Ids App Menu

The Ids App Menu serves as primary navigation for an Infor Application, combining top level functions of the application with user authentication and access to changing roles.

The App Menu is built on top of `[IdsDrawer](../ids-drawer/README.md) and generally utilizes an [IdsAccordion](../ids-accordion/README.md) and/or [IdsToolbar](../ids-toolbar/README.md) for its navigation features.
