# Masthead TODOs

- [ ] Add tabbable setting, and use arrow-keys to navigate buttons by default. See [Tim's comment](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise-wc/pull/456#pullrequestreview-829038844).
- [ ] Make example for Standalone css
- [ ] Make example for side-by-side comparison with legacy masthead component
- [ ] Make an attribute for the more-icon so that it's customizable
- [ ] Fix the way ids-buttons with visible-text appear in the popup menu
