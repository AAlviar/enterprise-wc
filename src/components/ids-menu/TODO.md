# TODO on IDS Menu

## Features

- [] Disabled state (entire menu)
- [] Ensure current aria labels work properly to describe groups (Voiceover doesn't currently read out group headers)
- [ ] Get aXe tests passing

## Ids Popup

- [] Add "flip" and "nudge" logic
- [] Might also need to create Ids Popup Boundary?

## Ids Popup Menu

- [] Shift + F10 to open (need to have different targets in Keyboard mixin)

## ContextMenu Mixin?

- [] Apply an IdsPopupMenu to an element with API for open/close and menu functions
