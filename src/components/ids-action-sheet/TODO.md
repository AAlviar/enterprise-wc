# Ids Action Sheet TODOs

## Major

- [ ] Rename `btnText` to `cancelBtnText` and make it update live.
- [ ] Keyboard is a bit wierd as you need to tab to the cancel button (all arrow keys should work)

## Minor

- [ ] Add Tray feature to Action Sheet but this may not be needed as could be replaced by floating action buttons.
- [ ] Add visual test for having no cancel button.
