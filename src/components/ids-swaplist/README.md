## Converting from Previous Version

### Converting from 4.x

The Ids SwapList is now a Web Component. Instead of using classes to define it, it is done directly with a custom element and attributes:

```html
<!-- 4.x example -->
// insert code sample from enterprise repo of that component

<!-- this is the same using the WebComponent -->
<ids-swaplist>
</ids-swaplist>
