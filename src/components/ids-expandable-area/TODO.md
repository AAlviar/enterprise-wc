# Ids Expandable Area TODOs

## Major

- [ ] Styling is not the same on https://main.wc.design.infor.com/ids-expandable-area/#0 as https://main-enterprise.demo.design.infor.com/components/expandablearea/example-index.html (use ids-data-label and button icon on wrong side)
- [ ] Styling design changes on https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/issues/5642
- [ ] Make the font size fixed size so it works on side-by-side.html
- [ ] Add events for `beforeexpand/beforecollapse` (vetoable), `expand/collapse`,`afterexpand/aftercollapse`
