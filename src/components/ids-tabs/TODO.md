# Tabs TODO's

## Phase 1

Tentative for Phase 1 but certain things e.g. overflows may need to  get done in Phase 2 since they are not directly functional depending on time.

- [] hashes
- [] ids-tab-divider: accessibility + axe tests
- [] detect overflows
- [] edge case: when user removes an option (either via through React/Angualur template or JS) that was selected, provide warning
- [] test: for keyboard events
- [] test: figure out how to get coveralls + Jest to detect certain parts of code
- [] test: figure out why ids-tab.selected = false doesn't trigger in Jest
- fix an issue with double firing of change
- some JSDoc
