- [x] API method/prop for toggling the `.audible` class on the text span
- [x] API method/prop for re-arranging the order of named text/icon slots?
- [x] get/set value() from menu? (store/report menu's current value)
- [x] "is-open" state or `button.popup.visible`
- [x] make it open a popup (maybe call this `IdsPopupButton`?)
- [x] Add a link that looks like a button (responsive button) example like the [old version]https://main-enterprise.demo.design.infor.com/components/button/example-as-link.html)
