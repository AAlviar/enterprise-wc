## Major

- [ ] Rendering: RTL axis on the wrong side
- [ ] Rendering: Axis and Rotated Labels
- [x] SVG Patterns for accessibility https://css-tricks.com/simple-patterns-for-separation/
- [x] Should be keyboard friendly. Can focus the legend and hit enter to select [see for suggestions](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/issues/6074) and in particular https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs/#aa-2-lets-make-it-accessible and https://accessibility.psu.edu/images/charts/
- [x] Chart Types: Line Chart
- [x] Chart Types: Area Chart

## Minor

- [ ] Rendering: Negative Values (bar/line)

- [ ] Make ids-axis chart extend without (this as any) in area-chart
- [ ] Add svg patterns and accessibility to line, area, bar stacked
- [ ] Maybe: Have a table option to actually display the data in optional data form
- [ ] Add accessibility once confirmed to area and line chart (only in bar now until tested) https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise-wc/commit/f6014597004ab7963ef66449bea63bfc43e95fa0
- [ ] RTL is not flipping https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42147119/how-to-flip-svg-coordinates

## Personal ----> Do from here down

- [ ] Interaction: When clicking the line it should select with focusable Legend (for selection)
- [ ] Chart Types: Pie Chart
- [ ] Add side by side examples and responsive examples
