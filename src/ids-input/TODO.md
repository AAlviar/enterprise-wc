# TODO - ids-input

## Basic Checks
- [x] Fix errors in the console
- [x] Use `ids-input` instead `ids-field`
- [x] The labels are not working (can't click them to focus the field). Tried adding a for and id and this didn't work. So what we should try to add the label in with input.

```html
<label for="x" />
<input id="x" />
```
- [x] Can we add more complete input styles from current uplift?
- [ ] Add tests functional and e2e
- [ ] Add docs and a typings file(s)

## Dirty Tracker

- [x] Remove property `useTrackdirty`
- [x] Maybe `ids-dirty-tracker` sounds better than `trackdirty`

## Labels

- [ ] Rename `ids-label` to `ids-text`
