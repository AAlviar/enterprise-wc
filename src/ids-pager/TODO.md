- ids-pager-number-list: update disabled state on all number buttons that are spawned.
- ids-pager: buttons should be non-rounded to match previous or keep consistent in new version?
(need feedback on this aspect particularly)
- documentation on new ids-pager
- separate example pages.
- more practical examples with data grid or list of content to paginate for clarity.
- handle values set incorrectly a bit better -- also need to figure out
how we will handle errors more easily for devs since we didn't agree on console
logging yet
- CHANGELOG
- right-hand menu component for selecting page ranges
- ids-attribute-provider-mixin README
(no TODO for mixins and created for this component so listing here)
