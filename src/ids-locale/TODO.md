# TODO For Locales

- [] RTL all components
- [] Number Inputs (value/mask)
- [] Date Inputs (value/mask)
- [] May have to review the need for Arabic Calendar as it included in Intl.DateTimeFormat we can try to use it via that
- [] may have to review the cases parseNumber has

## TODO For Phase 2

- [] Change fonts for some locales (how would we do this?)
