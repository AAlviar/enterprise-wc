# Ids Accordion TODO

- [x] Clean up Toggle functionality (better value store/checking on `expanded` setter)
- [ ] Animate the +/- sub-expander icon (new issue?)
- [ ] Improve new navigation methods to account for disabled/hidden/collapsed (children inside collapsed panes should become `tabIndex="-1"`)
- [ ] In-Page variant needs better nesting style (currently centered)
- [ ] App-menu/Sub-App-menu variants need theme modes/versions besides New Light
- [ ] Test Different Icon nesting levels
- [ ] Test RTL
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Update `d.ts` files for all accordion parts to reflect API changes
- [ ] Update docs with new features
