# Base Button

- [x] Default/Primary/Secondary/Tertiary styles
- [x] Pass "prototype" CSS classes (ids-button/ids-icon-button) from the corresponding JS classes.
- [x] Extra CSS classes (user defined)
- [x] Focusable prop
- [x] Disabled prop (figure out why it broke?)
- [ ] "Hide Focus" behavior (mixin?)
- [x] Ripple effect (take coords instead of mouse directly)
- [ ] Dispatch events?
- [x] Why doesn't the linter like `get protoClasses()` if it works?
- [ ] Lots of tests
