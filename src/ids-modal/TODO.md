# IDS Modal

- [] Examples with CSS parts
- [] Keep keyboard navigation within the Modal's boundaries (don't focus on anything outside the active modal)
- [] Shared overlay support (multiple modals with one overlay)
- [] Trigger an event on the "target" containing a value of some sort (useful for Lookup/etc)
- [] Disable/Enable all elements within the modal

## Modal Manager (Stack?)

This might be optional depending on how far we can get without it

- [] Bring over the Modal Manager from 4.x
- [] Create top-level containment for all modals (used by the stack)
